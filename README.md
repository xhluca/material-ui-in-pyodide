This demo was adapted from [this example](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/examples/cdn).

This is a simple demo of using the `material-ui` React component inside `pyodide`. Everything here is written using pure Python and uses pyodide, react, react-dom, and material-ui on the JS side. No other library was imported to make this work.
